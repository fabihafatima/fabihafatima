# Hi, I'm Fabeha Fatima 👋
 
💻 **Software Engineer** | ⚙️ **Microservices Maestro** | ✨ **Resume Tuner by Day, Leetcoder by Night**

### About Me
 
My coding journey began in 6th grade, with a dusty old desktop and a fresh Quick BASIC lesson on loops. After class, my teacher challenged us with a series problem — just for fun. While others ran out to play, I stayed back, excited and itching to crack the logic.

I used my recess to write the code, and by the next free period, I burst into the teacher’s room with my solution. It wasn’t the standard approach — in fact, it was a little wild — but it worked. The series? None other than the legendary Fibonacci. 🌀

That was the first time I realized code could be creative — not just correct. And that feeling of solving something your own way? Unmatched.

Since then, I’ve gone from skipping recess to skipping sleep (voluntarily 😅) — crafting code that not only scales and solves problems, but also inspires others. What began as a Quick BASIC script in a school lab has evolved into designing fault-tolerant, cloud-native systems, mentoring future engineers as a Tech Mentor and becoming the first software engineer in my family — it’s been quite the ride.

And yes, I still get a little nostalgic every time I see a Fibonacci spiral. 🐚

### Currrent Project
Absolutely! Here's your updated **UMate Finder** project description with a structured tech stack section in the style you've shown:

---

Currently building [**UMate**](https://github.com/fabihafatima/UMateFinder) — a full-stack roommate-matching platform designed to help students find compatible roommates based on lifestyle, habits, and housing preferences. Inspired by platforms like Bumble, UMate combines user-friendly design with smart matching to make student housing less stressful and more personal.

### Recent Projects I Built

Here are two of the major projects I completed recently:

* [**Distributed Stock Trading System**](https://github.com/fabihafatima/TradeNet) – A fault-tolerant, microservice-based trading platform built with **RESTful APIs, Docker, and AWS**, featuring **leader-follower replication**, **LRU caching with push-based invalidation**, and **crash recovery** under concurrent client load.

* [**LLMs to the Rescue**](https://github.com/fabihafatima/llms-to-the-rescue) – A research project leveraging **LLaMA 3.2** and **prompt-engineered style transfer** to tackle class imbalance in text classification. Enhanced minority class performance across RoBERTa and Logistic Regression using synthetically generated, context-preserving samples.


### 🚀 Other Cool Stuff I’ve Done

* ✈️ Created an AI-powered [**Travel Planner**](https://github.com/fabihafatima/llms-to-the-rescue) using **Python, React, and Java Spring Boot**, capable of generating personalized itineraries, destination suggestions, and packing checklists with the help of **LLaMA 3.2**.

* 💳 Built [**FraudSpark**](https://github.com/fabihafatima/FraudSpark-Real-Time-Fraud-Detection-System), a real-time fraud detection system using **Kafka, PySpark**, and a **Random Forest Classifier**, optimized for imbalanced datasets to flag suspicious transactions at scale.

* 🎙️ Designed a [**Speech Emotion Detector**](https://github.com/fabihafatima/Speech-Emotion-Detector-using-Deep-Learning) by fusing **CNNs with Decision Trees**, achieving **83.56% accuracy** on the RAVDESS dataset using **MFCC and chroma features**.
