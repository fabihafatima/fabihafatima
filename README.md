## ✨ About Me  
My coding journey began in 6th grade with a dusty old desktop and a fresh Quick BASIC lesson on loops. After class, our teacher threw a challenge — just for fun. While others ran out to play, I stayed back, excited to crack the logic.

I used my recess to write the code, and by the next free period, I burst into the teacher’s room with a solution. It wasn’t conventional — a little wild, honestly — but it worked. The series? None other than the legendary Fibonacci. 🌀

That was the first time I realized code could be **creative**, not just correct. And that feeling of solving something your own way? **Unmatched.**

Since then, I’ve gone from skipping recess to skipping sleep (voluntarily 😅) — crafting code that scales, solves, and inspires. What began as a Quick BASIC script became designing **fault-tolerant cloud-native systems**, mentoring future engineers 👩‍🏫, and becoming the **first software engineer in my family**. What a ride. 🚀

And yes, I still get nostalgic every time I see a Fibonacci spiral. 🐚

## 🛠️ Current Project  

I'm currently building [**UMate**](https://github.com/fabihafatima/UMateFinder) — a full-stack roommate-matching platform designed to help students find compatible roommates based on lifestyle, habits, and housing preferences. Inspired by platforms like Bumble, UMate combines user-friendly design with smart matching to make student housing less stressful and more personal.
